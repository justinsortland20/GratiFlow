## Project Overview

GratiFlow is a web application, which I designed to help others cultivate gratitude by creating and managing gratitude entries. The app also features user authentication, retrieval of Firebase firestore data, and sentiment analysis, which can be tracked over time on a graph located on the Profile page.

## Project Structure

* **src/components** contains UI componenets which are used on most pages on the site, such as the navigation bar (`Navbar.js`) and the font type and size selectors (`FontSelector.js`).

* **src/firebase** contains Firebase configuration (`firebase.js`) and authentication logic (`auth.js`)

* **src/pages** contains the main pages of the application, including `Dashboard.js`, `Entries.js`, `Profile.js`, etc.
